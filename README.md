### 1. Problem Definition

Based on the available data (Location, Maker, Model, Year, Colour, Amount (Million Naira), Type, Distance) of a car, can I predict the price (Amount (Million Naira)) the company should sell a car?

### 2. Data

The data is from the Learning Competition for AI Invasion 2022 hosted on zindi.africa platform by DSN.

### 3. Evaluation

The evaluation metric for this competition is Root Mean Squared Error.
For every row in the dataset, submission files should contain 2 columns: ID and Target.
Your submission file should look like this (numbers to show format only):

VehicleID    Amount (Million Naira)   
VHL11998             8.95   
VHL12002             3.00
